# Connected_Graph

*2019.9.12* 

from the interview of Deep Force

There is a map of several cities, the city will be connected to the city by road, but some of the cities won't be connected to the other cities.
Please write a function to return a **boolean** to show if you can arrive all the cities on the map no matter where you are.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/due32101/Interview_test/blob/master/connected_graph/images/example.png)

In Figure(a), A, B, C, D are connected to each other, but E,F aren't connected to other cities, so in this case, you should return **False**; In Figure(b), A, B, C, D, E, F are connected to each other, so you should return **True**

The input data will be an matrix, the matrix of Figure(a) is shown as:
```
[[1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,1,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,1,1]]
```
The matrix of Figure(b) is shown as
```
[[1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,1,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,0],
 [0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,1,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,1,1]]
```
The columns and rows are A, B, C, D, E, F


â€»The test cases contain 6 graphs:
